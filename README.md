# The project

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I've curated a collection of typical React UI components at [uicode.mirado.work](https://uicode.mirado.work). The collection spans from atomic components like buttons to more substantial ones such as forms, navigation, hero section and beyond. Each component is crafted using React and CSS modules (Support for Tailwind will be gradually implemented).

### This repo

This is the repository for the web platform. You can see it in action at [uicode.mirado.work](https://uicode.mirado.work) or run it locally (see installation method bellow).

### The components

Components source code are located in:

```shell
src/code/components
```

## Installation

This webapp is based on Next.js 14, so it needs NodeJS to be installed first, and install required package.

### Install npm package

```shell
npm install
```

### Run locally

```shell

Available on http://localhost:3000

Additionally, you may need to build the scss files for the layout of the web app, so do:
